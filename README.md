# word_visualizer

This is a short script I wrote to help me play [Word Ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_ladder).
It relies on NetworkX and Matplotlib, and the words used are thanks to the open-source [Wordnik Wordlist](https://github.com/wordnik/wordlist). It supports words that are 4, 5, or 6 characters long, and I've also included the corresponding sets of words as raw text files.

Just run `word.py`, enter your starting and ending words, and start guessing!
